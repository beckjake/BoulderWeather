Gets weather from http://foehn.colorado.edu/weather/atoc1/ and displays (some of) it in readable form on your android device.

There are two ways to download this file:
	- the binary in the bin/ directory, which contains a debug .apk. This includes Log statements. This is possibly broken at any given time.
	- the binary on the Downloads page, which has had Log statements stripped out. This is guaranteed stable-ish. (as of this release).


Version: 1.1b1

TODO for v1.1:
	get the last couple lines of the table (currently ignored)
